          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            I am a Backend Developer trainee at functionUp. During my training, 
            I have completed 5+ projects using Backend technologies. Talking about 
            my Technical skills - I am skilled in JavaScript, NodeJs, Expressjs, 
            MongoDB, AWS S3, Redis, Mysql, Python, Java and some tools - VS Code, Postman.
            I specialize in building responsive back-end API&apos;s that connect with front end applications.
          </p>
          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is
            more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient
            in building back-end applications using NodeJS, MongoDb, Javascript, and
            Mysql, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as
            needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one
            specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.
